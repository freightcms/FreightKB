A Freight MMSI (Maritime Mobile Service Identity) number is a unique identifier assigned to a vessel for communication purposes within the maritime mobile service. MMSI numbers are used primarily in the Automatic Identification System (AIS), which is a tracking system used by ships and maritime authorities to exchange vessel information, enhance safety, and prevent collisions at sea.

While MMSI numbers are commonly associated with vessels, the term "Freight MMSI number" seems to be a misnomer or a term specific to a certain context or industry. It's possible that it refers to a specialized type of MMSI number used by freight vessels or shipping companies for tracking and communication related to their cargo operations. However, without further information or clarification, it is difficult to provide more specific details about a Freight MMSI number.
