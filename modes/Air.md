An ocean shipment typically requires several attributes to facilitate the transportation of goods by sea. Here are some essential attributes associated with an ocean shipment:

1. Shipping Container: Goods transported by ocean usually need to be properly packed and secured in standardized shipping containers. These containers come in various sizes and types, such as 20-foot or 40-foot containers, depending on the volume and nature of the cargo.

2. Shipping Documentation: Various documents are necessary for an ocean shipment, including a bill of lading, commercial invoice, packing list, and any required permits or certificates. These documents provide information about the goods being shipped, their origin, destination, and other relevant details.

3. Freight Forwarder/Shipping Agent: A freight forwarder or shipping agent plays a crucial role in organizing and coordinating the ocean shipment. They handle the logistics, documentation, customs requirements, and other aspects of the transportation process on behalf of the shipper.

4. Carrier and Vessel: An ocean shipment requires a shipping carrier, which is typically a shipping line or a container vessel operator. The carrier operates the vessels that transport the cargo across the ocean. The shipper or freight forwarder arranges the booking with the carrier to secure space on the vessel.

5. Port of Loading and Port of Discharge: The ocean shipment involves identifying the specific ports of loading and discharge. The port of loading is where the cargo is loaded onto the vessel, while the port of discharge is the destination port where the cargo will be unloaded.

6. Customs Clearance: Customs procedures and clearance are an integral part of an ocean shipment. The shipper or the appointed customs broker must comply with customs regulations of both the origin and destination countries to facilitate the smooth movement of the cargo.

7. Insurance: Shippers often opt for marine cargo insurance to protect their goods against potential loss or damage during transit. Insurance coverage can be arranged through insurance brokers or freight forwarders.

8. Freight Rates and Charges: The cost of an ocean shipment includes freight rates and various charges, such as port handling charges, documentation fees, customs duties, and any additional services required, such as warehousing or inland transportation.

9. Transit Time and Schedule: The transit time, or the duration it takes for the cargo to reach the destination, is an important attribute of an ocean shipment. Shippers need to consider the schedule and estimated arrival time to plan their logistics and meet customer demands.

10. Tracking and Tracing: Many shipping lines and freight forwarders provide online tracking and tracing systems, allowing shippers to monitor the progress of their ocean shipments. This provides visibility and helps in managing supply chain operations effectively.

It's important to note that specific requirements and attributes of an ocean shipment may vary depending on the nature of the goods, the trade route, the countries involved, and any applicable regulations or agreements.
