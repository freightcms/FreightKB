**<a href="/modes/ocean">Ocean freight</a> charges refer** to the costs associated with transporting goods by sea. When shipping goods internationally or across large bodies of water, ocean freight is a common and cost-effective mode of transportation. The charges associated with ocean freight can vary depending on several factors, including:

- **Freight Rate:** The freight rate is the primary cost of shipping goods by sea. It is typically calculated based on the volume or weight of the cargo, as well as the distance traveled. Freight rates can be expressed as a fixed amount per container (e.g., per twenty-foot equivalent unit, or TEU) or as a rate per unit of weight (e.g., per ton).

- **Container Costs:** If you're shipping goods in containers, there may be additional charges associated with container usage. These charges include container rental fees, equipment positioning charges, and fees for additional services such as container loading and unloading.

- **Port Charges:** Ports levy various charges for the handling and processing of cargo. These charges can include <a href="/locations/terminal">terminal</a> handling charges, port dues, wharfage fees, and customs fees. The specific charges vary from port to port and depend on the services provided.

- **Fuel Surcharges:** Fuel surcharges are additional fees imposed to account for fluctuations in fuel prices. As fuel costs are a significant component of shipping expenses, <a href="/carriers/">carriers</a> may apply surcharges to compensate for price changes in the market.
