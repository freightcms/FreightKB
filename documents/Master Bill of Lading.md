A Master Bill of Lading (MBL) is a legal shipping document issued by the carrier or freight forwarder. It serves as a contract of carriage and receipt of goods for international shipments involving multiple parties, such as freight forwarders, consolidators, and shipping lines.

The MBL is typically issued by the shipping line or the carrier responsible for the main transport leg of the shipment. It outlines the terms and conditions of the transportation contract and includes important information such as the names and addresses of the shipper, consignee, and carrier, as well as details about the goods being shipped.

One key feature of the MBL is that it covers the entire shipment from the port of origin to the final destination. It acts as a master document that governs the relationship between the carrier and the shipper. However, when the goods are divided into smaller shipments, the carrier may issue House Bills of Lading (HBLs) to each individual shipper or consolidator involved in the transaction.

The MBL also serves as a transferable document, allowing the shipper or freight forwarder to endorse or transfer its rights to another party, such as a consignee or another freight forwarder. This flexibility enables the consolidation and deconsolidation of cargo during the transportation process.

Overall, the Master Bill of Lading is an essential document in international shipping, as it provides a legal record of the shipment's details, terms, and conditions, while facilitating the smooth movement of goods between multiple parties involved in the logistics chain.
