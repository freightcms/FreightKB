A Bill of Lading (B/L) is a legal document issued by a carrier, such as a shipping line, trucking company, or freight forwarder. It serves as a receipt for the goods being shipped and also represents a contract of carriage between the shipper (consignor) and the carrier.

The Bill of Lading contains essential information about the shipment, including the type and quantity of goods being transported, the names and addresses of the shipper and consignee (receiver), the origin and destination of the shipment, the shipping method, and any special instructions or requirements.

The document serves multiple purposes:

1. Evidence of contract: The Bill of Lading acts as evidence that a contract of carriage exists between the shipper and the carrier. It outlines the terms and conditions of the transportation agreement, including the agreed-upon freight rates and any specific instructions.

2. Receipt of goods: It serves as a receipt issued by the carrier upon receiving the goods from the shipper. The carrier acknowledges the quantity and condition of the goods at the time of shipment, and the shipper can use the Bill of Lading to verify that the goods were delivered to the carrier in the agreed-upon condition.

3. Title of ownership: The Bill of Lading can act as a title document for the goods being transported. In some cases, it can be negotiable, meaning that it can be transferred or assigned to a third party, enabling the third party to take possession of the goods upon presentation of the Bill of Lading.

4. Transport instructions: The document provides instructions to the carrier regarding the routing, handling, and delivery of the goods. It may specify the mode of transportation (e.g., sea, air, road), any transshipment points, and any special requirements for handling or delivery.

The Bill of Lading plays a crucial role in international trade and shipping, facilitating the movement of goods, ensuring accountability, and providing a legal framework for the parties involved in the transportation process.
