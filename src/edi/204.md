The EDI 204 is a standardized electronic data interchange (EDI) transaction set used in the transportation industry. It is part of the ANSI X12 EDI standard, which defines the format and structure for exchanging business documents electronically.

The EDI 204 transaction set, also known as the Motor Carrier Load Tender, is used by shippers or brokers to offer a shipment to a motor carrier. It provides detailed information about the shipment, including pickup and delivery locations, scheduled dates and times, equipment requirements, and other relevant instructions.

Here are some of the key data elements typically included in an EDI 204 transaction:

1. Load Identification: A unique identifier assigned to the shipment.
2. Equipment Requirements: Specification of the type and quantity of equipment required for the shipment, such as trailers or containers.
3. Pickup and Delivery Information: Details about the origin and destination locations, including addresses, contact information, and any specific instructions.
4. Dates and Times: Scheduled dates and times for pickup and delivery.
5. Shipment Details: Information about the goods being transported, including weight, quantity, dimensions, and special handling requirements.
6. Special Instructions: Any additional instructions or requirements related to the shipment.

By using the EDI 204 transaction, businesses can automate and streamline the process of tendering loads to motor carriers, reducing manual paperwork and improving efficiency in the transportation supply chain.
