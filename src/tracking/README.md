Freight tracking, also known as <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> tracking or cargo tracking, refers to the process of monitoring and tracing the movement of goods or <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> from their point of origin to their final destination. It allows shippers, consignees, and other relevant parties to have real-time visibility and information about the status, <a href="/locations/">location,</a>  and estimated time of arrival (ETA) of their freight.

Freight tracking typically involves the use of tracking numbers or unique identifiers assigned to each <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipment.</a> These identifiers are associated with the freight and can be used to retrieve detailed information about its journey. Tracking information can include data such as the departure and arrival times, intermediate stops, transportation modes used (e.g., truck, ship, airplane), and sometimes even temperature and humidity conditions for sensitive goods.

Tracking systems can vary depending on the transportation provider or logistics company involved. Many shipping<a href="/carriers/">carriers</a>and <a href="/parties/freight-forwarder">freight forwarders</a> offer online tracking portals or mobile applications where <a href="/parties/customers">customers</a> can enter their tracking numbers to access real-time updates on their shipments. These updates may include <a href="/locations/">location</a> updates, delivery attempts, customs clearance status, and any exceptions or delays encountered during transit.

Freight tracking provides several benefits, including improved <a href="/parties/customers">customer</a> service by keeping <a href="/parties/customers">customers</a> informed about their shipments, enhanced supply chain visibility, the ability to proactively address delays or issues, and increased operational efficiency by optimizing logistics and transportation processes. It is particularly valuable for businesses that rely on the timely and secure delivery of goods, as well as for individuals who want to monitor the progress of their packages or shipments.
