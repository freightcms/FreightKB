A freight carrier, also known as a freight forwarder or shipping carrier, is a company or organization that specializes in the transportation of goods from one location to another. Freight carriers play a crucial role in the logistics industry by providing transportation services for various types of cargo, including raw materials, finished products, and other items.

Freight carriers facilitate the movement of goods through different modes of transportation, such as trucks, trains, ships, and airplanes. They manage the entire process of shipping, including documentation, packaging, loading, transportation, and delivery. Depending on the distance and the nature of the cargo, freight carriers may employ different modes of transport or use a combination of them, such as trucking for short distances, rail for intermodal transport, or airfreight for faster delivery.

Freight carriers offer a range of services to meet the diverse needs of businesses and individuals involved in shipping goods. These services may include:

1. Freight forwarding: Coordinating the shipment process, including arranging transportation, customs clearance, and documentation.
2. Warehousing: Providing storage facilities for goods before or after transportation.
3. Packaging and labeling: Ensuring proper packaging and labeling of goods to protect them during transit and comply with regulations.
4. Tracking and tracing: Providing real-time tracking information to monitor the progress of shipments.
5. Customs brokerage: Assisting with customs documentation and compliance for international shipments.
6. Insurance: Offering cargo insurance to protect against loss or damage during transit.

Freight carriers typically work with a network of partners and service providers to handle different aspects of the shipping process. They may collaborate with trucking companies, shipping lines, airlines, customs agencies, and other entities to ensure smooth and efficient transportation of goods.
