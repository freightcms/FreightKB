LTL (Less Than Truckload) freight charges can vary depending on several factors. Here are some common charges associated with LTL freight:

1. Base Rate: The base rate is the fundamental charge for transporting LTL freight. It typically covers the costs of pickup, transportation, and delivery within a specified geographic area.

2. Weight: LTL shipments are charged based on their weight. Carriers have weight brackets or classes that determine the pricing. The weight of the shipment, including the packaging and pallet, is considered for determining the charges.

3. Distance: The distance the freight needs to travel plays a role in the charges. Carriers may have different pricing structures based on zones or mileage bands. The farther the distance, the higher the transportation charges are likely to be.

4. Dimensions: The size or dimensions of the LTL shipment can affect the charges. Carriers may have restrictions on maximum length, width, height, and cubic volume. Oversized or non-standard shipments may incur additional charges.

5. Accessorials: Accessorial charges are additional services or requirements beyond the basic transportation. Examples include liftgate service (if the pickup or delivery location lacks a loading dock), inside delivery, residential delivery, notification or appointment scheduling, and hazardous materials handling. Each accessorials service may have its own separate charge.

6. Freight Class: LTL shipments are assigned a freight class based on their density, stowability, handling, and liability. The National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) provides a standardized classification system ranging from class 50 to class 500. Higher-class freight generally incurs higher charges.

7. Fuel Surcharge: Fuel surcharges are common in the transportation industry. They fluctuate based on the price of fuel and help carriers offset the fuel costs associated with transporting goods.

It's important to note that specific charges and pricing structures can vary between different LTL carriers and may be subject to negotiation or contractual agreements. It's advisable to consult with specific carriers or freight brokers to get accurate and up-to-date information on LTL freight charges.
