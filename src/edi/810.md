EDI 810 refers to an electronic data interchange (EDI) transaction set that is used in business-to-business (B2B) communications. Specifically, EDI 810 is the standard format for transmitting an invoice electronically between trading partners. It is part of the ANSI X12 EDI standard, which is widely used in North America.

The EDI 810 document contains key information related to a commercial invoice, including details such as:

1. Billing and payment terms: It specifies the agreed-upon terms for payment, such as due date, discount terms, and late payment penalties.
2. Itemized charges: The invoice provides a breakdown of individual products, services, or charges, along with their quantities, prices, and any applicable discounts or taxes.
3. Shipping and delivery information: It includes details about the shipment, such as shipping dates, tracking numbers, carrier information, and delivery instructions.
4. Purchase order references: If the invoice corresponds to a specific purchase order, the EDI 810 may reference the relevant purchase order number for easy reconciliation and verification.
5. Remittance details: The document may include information on how and where to send payment, such as bank account details or instructions for electronic funds transfer (EFT).

By using the standardized format of EDI 810, trading partners can streamline their invoicing processes, reduce manual data entry, minimize errors, and enhance efficiency in their business transactions.
