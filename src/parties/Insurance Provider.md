In the context of freight, an **insurance provider** refers to a company or entity that offers insurance coverage specifically for freight or cargo shipments. Freight insurance is designed to protect the value of goods being transported against various risks and perils that can occur during transit, such as theft, damage, loss, or other unforeseen circumstances.

**insurance provider**s specializing in freight or cargo insurance work with businesses, <a href="/parties/freight-forwarder">freight forwarders,</a> logistics companies, and individuals involved in the transportation of goods. They offer different types of insurance policies tailored to meet the specific needs of their clients. These policies may cover a wide range of transportation <a href="/modes">modes,</a> including shipping by sea, air, rail, or truck.

**insurance provider**s for freight typically offer two primary types of coverage:

- All-Risk Coverage: This type of insurance provides comprehensive protection for goods during transit, covering a broad range of risks and perils. All-risk coverage generally offers more extensive protection but may have certain exclusions or limitations specified in the policy.

- Named Perils Coverage: With this type of coverage, specific risks or perils are listed in the policy, and the insurance will only cover losses caused by those named perils. Common named perils may include fire, theft, collision, overturning of the vehicle, natural disasters, and others.

Freight **insurance provider**s assess the value of the cargo, the shipping route, the <a href="/modes">modes,</a> of transportation, and various other factors to determine the cost of the insurance coverage. They also establish terms and conditions, including deductibles, coverage limits, and specific exclusions.
