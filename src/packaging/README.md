Freight packaging refers to the process of preparing and securing goods or products for transportation via freight<a href="/carriers/">carriers</a>such as trucks, ships, or airplanes. The goal of freight packaging is to ensure that the items being shipped arrive at their destination safely and in optimal condition.

Freight packaging involves several key considerations:

- **Protection:** The packaging materials and design should provide adequate protection to the goods during transportation. This includes protecting against impact, vibration, compression, moisture, and other potential hazards.

- **Durability:** The packaging must be sturdy and durable enough to withstand the rigors of transportation, including stacking, handling, and potential rough conditions.

- **Size and Weight:** The packaging should be optimized to minimize the dimensions and weight of the <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipment.</a> This helps reduce shipping costs and makes handling more efficient.

- **Compliance:** Freight packaging needs to comply with the regulations and guidelines of the transportation industry. This may include following specific packaging standards, such as those set by the International Safe Transit Association (ISTA) or <a href="/carriers/iata">International Air Transport Association (IATA)</a>, especially for hazardous materials.

- **Labeling and Documentation:** The packaging should have appropriate labels, markings, and documentation to identify the contents, provide handling instructions, and comply with legal requirements, including customs documentation for international shipments.

- **Palletization and Unitization:** For larger shipments, goods are often palletized or unitized, meaning they are stacked and secured on pallets or placed in containers to facilitate handling and transportation.

Freight packaging can involve a variety of materials, including cardboard boxes, wooden crates, plastic wrap, foam inserts, and cushioning materials like bubble wrap or packing peanuts. The specific packaging materials and techniques used depend on factors such as the nature of the goods, their fragility, and the mode of transportation.

Overall, the primary objective of freight packaging is to ensure that the products are protected, efficiently transported, and arrive at their destination intact and in good condition.
