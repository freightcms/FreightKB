A less than truckload (LTL) <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> refers to a freight <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> that does not require the use of an entire truck trailer. LTL<a href="/carriers/">carriers</a>consolidate multiple smaller <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> from different <a href="/parties/shipper">shippers</a> into a single trailer, optimizing space and reducing costs. Here are some key attributes that a less than truckload <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> typically needs to have:

- Smaller Size: LTL <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> are generally smaller in size compared to full truckload (FTL) shipments. They usually occupy a fraction of the available trailer space.

- Weight Limit: LTL <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> have weight restrictions, often ranging from around 150 to 20,000 pounds (68 to 9,072 kilograms). The exact weight limit varies depending on the carrier and the equipment they use.

- Packaging and Palletization: LTL <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> need to be appropriately packaged and palletized to ensure safe transportation. Proper packaging helps protect the goods from damage during handling and transit.

- Consignment Documentation: LTL <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> require accurate and detailed consignment documentation, including a bill of lading (BOL), which specifies the origin, destination, contents, weight, and other relevant information about the <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipment.</a>

- Freight Class: Each LTL <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> is assigned a freight class, which is determined by its density, stowability, handling requirements, and liability. The freight class helps determine the shipping rates and any additional charges associated with the <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipment.</a>

- Pick-up and Delivery Flexibility: LTL<a href="/carriers/">carriers</a>typically offer pick-up and delivery services to and from various <a href="/locations/">locations.</a>  <a href="/parties/shipper">shippers</a> should ensure that their <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> can be conveniently picked up from the origin and delivered to the destination, considering factors such as access restrictions and time frames.

- Tracking and Tracing: LTL<a href="/carriers/">carriers</a>provide tracking and tracing services to monitor the progress and <a href="/locations/">location</a> of the <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipment.</a> This helps both the <a href="/parties/shipper">shipper</a> and the recipient stay informed about the status of the <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> and its estimated time of arrival.

- Freight Insurance: Depending on the value and nature of the goods being shipped, it is advisable to consider appropriate freight insurance to cover any potential loss or damage during transit.

It's important to note that specific requirements and attributes may vary depending on the LTL <a href="/carriers/">carrier,</a> regional regulations, and the nature of the goods being shipped. <a href="/parties/shipper">shippers</a> should always consult with their chosen carrier to understand their specific guidelines and requirements for LTL shipments.
