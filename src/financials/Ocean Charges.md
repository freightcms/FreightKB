Ocean freight charges refer to the costs associated with transporting goods by sea. When shipping goods internationally or across large bodies of water, ocean freight is a common and cost-effective mode of transportation. The charges associated with ocean freight can vary depending on several factors, including:

1. Freight Rate: The freight rate is the primary cost of shipping goods by sea. It is typically calculated based on the volume or weight of the cargo, as well as the distance traveled. Freight rates can be expressed as a fixed amount per container (e.g., per twenty-foot equivalent unit, or TEU) or as a rate per unit of weight (e.g., per ton).

2. Container Costs: If you're shipping goods in containers, there may be additional charges associated with container usage. These charges include container rental fees, equipment positioning charges, and fees for additional services such as container loading and unloading.

3. Port Charges: Ports levy various charges for the handling and processing of cargo. These charges can include terminal handling charges, port dues, wharfage fees, and customs fees. The specific charges vary from port to port and depend on the services provided.

4. Fuel Surcharges: Fuel surcharges are additional fees imposed to account for fluctuations in fuel prices. As fuel costs are a significant component of shipping expenses, carriers may apply surcharges to compensate for price changes in the market.

5. Documentation and Administration Fees: Shipping goods internationally involves extensive documentation and administrative processes. Freight forwarders or shipping lines may charge fees for services such as bill of lading preparation, customs documentation, and cargo insurance.

6. Additional Services: Depending on your requirements, you may incur extra charges for value-added services such as cargo tracking, customs clearance, warehousing, or special handling for hazardous or oversized cargo.

It's important to note that ocean freight charges can vary based on several factors, including the shipping route, distance, cargo volume, shipping line, and current market conditions. Working with a freight forwarder or shipping line can help provide accurate and up-to-date cost estimates for your specific shipment.
