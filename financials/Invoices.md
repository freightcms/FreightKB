A freight invoice is a document used in the transportation and logistics industry to provide a detailed breakdown of charges and fees associated with the shipment of goods or cargo. It serves as a billing statement issued by the carrier or freight forwarder to the shipper or consignee, outlining the financial aspects of the transportation service provided.

The freight invoice typically includes the following information:

1. Sender and recipient details: The names, addresses, and contact information of the shipper (sender) and consignee (recipient) involved in the shipment.

2. Shipment details: Information related to the transported goods, such as the description, quantity, weight, dimensions, and any special handling requirements.

3. Carrier information: The name, address, and contact details of the carrier responsible for transporting the goods. This may include the carrier's unique identification number or code.

4. Charges and fees: A comprehensive breakdown of the costs associated with the transportation service. This may include items such as freight charges, fuel surcharges, handling fees, customs duties (if applicable), insurance costs, and any additional services provided.

5. Payment terms: The payment due date, accepted payment methods, and any applicable discounts or penalties for late payments.

6. Terms and conditions: Any specific terms and conditions related to the transportation service, such as liability limitations, claims procedures, and dispute resolution mechanisms.

Freight invoices are crucial for both the shipper and the carrier as they facilitate accurate record-keeping, financial reconciliation, and dispute resolution. They also serve as a basis for payment processing and auditing purposes, ensuring transparency and accountability in the freight transportation process.
