**Freight line items** refer to specific charges or costs associated with the transportation of goods or cargo. When shipping goods, especially in the context of commercial transactions, there are various expenses and fees involved beyond the actual transportation cost. These additional charges are typically itemized as **freight line items**. Here are some common examples:

- **Freight charges:** This includes the cost of transporting the goods from the point of origin to the destination. It can be calculated based on factors such as weight, distance, mode of transportation, and any additional services required (e.g., express shipping).

- **Fuel surcharge:** As fuel prices fluctuate, <a href="/carriers/">carriers</a> may add a fuel surcharge to cover the increased costs of fuel consumption during transportation. This surcharge helps offset the impact of fuel price variations.

- **Handling fees:** These fees are associated with tasks such as loading, unloading, and handling the goods at different stages of the transportation process, including at the origin and destination terminals.

- **Insurance:** Freight insurance provides coverage for potential loss, damage, or theft of the goods during transit. The insurance premium or fee is often listed as a separate line item.

- **Customs duties and fees:** When shipping goods across international borders, customs duties, taxes, and other fees may apply. These charges are levied by the respective countries' customs authorities and are usually the responsibility of the importer or consignee.

- **Documentation fees:** Certain administrative costs related to document preparation, such as bills of lading, commercial invoices, and customs declarations, may be included as line items.

- **Surcharge for special services:** If special services are required during transportation, such as expedited delivery, liftgate service, or hazardous materials handling, additional charges may be added to cover the associated costs.

It's important to note that the specific **freight line items** and their names can vary depending on the <a href="/carriers/">carrier,</a>  shipping route, mode of transportation (air, sea, land), and the terms negotiated between the parties involved in the <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipment.</a>
