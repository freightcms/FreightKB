In the context of various industries, a "shipper" typically refers to a person or organization that is responsible for shipping or transporting goods from one location to another. The shipper is usually the entity that initiates the transportation process by arranging for the shipment of goods. This term is commonly used in logistics, supply chain management, and transportation industries.

The shipper's role involves several tasks, including:

1. Packaging and labeling: The shipper ensures that the goods are properly packaged and labeled according to shipping regulations and requirements. This includes choosing appropriate packaging materials and marking the packages with relevant information such as addresses, tracking numbers, and handling instructions.

2. Booking transportation: The shipper makes arrangements with transportation providers, such as shipping lines, airlines, trucking companies, or courier services, to transport the goods to the intended destination. This involves selecting the most suitable mode of transportation and negotiating rates and schedules.

3. Documentation: The shipper prepares and completes the necessary shipping documents, such as bills of lading, invoices, customs forms, and export/import documentation. These documents ensure legal compliance, facilitate customs clearance, and provide essential information about the shipment.

4. Cargo insurance: Depending on the terms of the sale or agreement, the shipper may also be responsible for obtaining cargo insurance to protect the goods against loss, damage, or theft during transit.

5. Tracking and coordination: Throughout the shipping process, the shipper monitors the movement of the goods, tracks their progress, and coordinates with carriers, freight forwarders, and other relevant parties to ensure smooth and timely delivery.
