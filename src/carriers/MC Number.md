A Freight **MC number**, also known as an MC (Motor Carrier) Number, is a unique identifier assigned to for-hire motor <a href="/carriers/">carriers</a> (trucking companies) by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) in the United States. The **MC number** is used to track and monitor the operations of motor <a href="/carriers/">carriers</a> engaged in interstate commerce.

Obtaining an **MC number** is a requirement for motor <a href="/carriers/">carriers</a> nvolved in transporting regulated commodities or providing transportation services across state lines. It serves as proof of registration with the FMCSA and is used for various regulatory and safety purposes. The **MC number** is displayed on the sides of commercial motor vehicles to identify the carrier and facilitate inspections and enforcement activities.

The **MC number** is part of a larger identifier called the <a href="usdot">USDOT</a> (United States Department of Transportation) Number, which is also assigned by the FMCSA. The **MC number** is typically issued in combination with the <a href="usdot">USDOT</a> Number and is often referred to as MC/<a href="usdot">USDOT</a> Number.
