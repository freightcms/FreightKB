A freight supplier, also known as a freight provider or freight <a href="/carriers/">carrier,</a> is a company or organization that offers transportation services for the movement of goods or cargo. These companies specialize in the logistics and management of shipping and transportation, helping businesses and individuals transport their goods from one <a href="/locations/">location</a> to another.

Freight suppliers can provide various modes of transportation depending on the nature of the cargo and the <a href="/parties/customers">customer.</a>s requirements. They may offer services such as:

- Trucking: Freight suppliers may have a fleet of trucks to transport goods over short or long distances on roads and highways.

- Shipping: They may have partnerships with shipping lines and provide services for transporting goods via sea or inland waterways. This is often used for international <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> or when large quantities of goods need to be transported.

- Airfreight: Freight suppliers can offer air cargo services, using airlines and cargo planes to transport goods quickly over long distances or for time-sensitive shipments.

- Rail freight: Some freight suppliers have access to rail networks and provide rail freight services for the transportation of goods across land.

- Intermodal transportation: Freight suppliers may offer intermodal services, which involve using multiple modes of transportation (such as combining trucking, rail, and shipping) to transport goods efficiently and cost-effectively.

Freight suppliers typically handle various aspects of the transportation process, including pickup, packaging, documentation, customs clearance (for international shipments), tracking, and delivery. They may also offer additional services like warehousing, freight forwarding, and supply chain management.

Businesses and individuals rely on freight suppliers to ensure the safe and timely delivery of their goods, making them an integral part of the global logistics and supply chain industry.
