An ELD stands for Electronic Logging Device. It is a device that is used in the trucking and transportation industry to monitor and record a driver's Hours of Service (HOS) electronically. The ELD is connected to the vehicle's engine and captures data such as engine hours, vehicle movement, miles driven, and other relevant information.

The primary purpose of an ELD is to ensure compliance with the regulations set by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) in the United States. These regulations govern the maximum number of hours a commercial driver can be on duty and drive within a specific timeframe. ELDs replace traditional paper logbooks, making it easier to track and enforce HOS regulations accurately.

ELDs automatically record a driver's driving time, breaks, and rest periods, eliminating the need for manual input or paper records. The data collected by the ELD can be accessed by both the driver and authorized enforcement personnel. It provides an accurate and reliable method of tracking a driver's compliance with HOS rules, enhancing safety on the roads and preventing fatigue-related accidents.

ELDs also offer additional features such as GPS tracking, automated notifications, and integration with other systems, which can help fleet managers optimize operations, improve efficiency, and enhance overall compliance with regulatory requirements.
