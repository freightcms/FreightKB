Freight classes, also known as NMFC (National Motor Freight Classification) codes, are a standardized system used in the shipping and transportation industry to categorize and classify different types of freight based on their characteristics. These classes are primarily used for less-than-truckload (LTL) shipments, where multiple shipments from different customers are consolidated onto a single truck.

The purpose of assigning freight classes is to establish a uniform method for determining shipping rates, liability, and handling requirements for various types of cargo. The classification takes into account several factors, including the density, stowability, handling, and liability of the freight. By assigning a freight class, carriers can accurately price the shipment based on its characteristics and the associated costs of handling and transporting it.

The NMFC assigns 18 different freight classes, ranging from class 50 to class 500, with class 50 representing the least dense and easiest to handle freight, and class 500 representing the densest and most challenging to handle. The classification is based on a numerical scale, with lower classes generally indicating lighter, less bulky, and easier-to-handle freight, while higher classes represent heavier, bulkier, and more complex freight.

The freight class determination takes into consideration various factors, such as the commodity's value, fragility, handling requirements, liability for damage, and ease of loading and unloading. The NMFC provides guidelines and descriptions for each class to help shippers and carriers determine the appropriate classification for their freight.

It's important to note that accurate classification of freight is crucial to ensure proper pricing and compliance with shipping regulations. Shippers are responsible for determining the correct freight class, typically with the assistance of a freight broker or carrier, to avoid issues or unexpected costs during the transportation process.
