EDI 940 refers to the X12 Transaction Set, specifically known as the "Warehouse Shipping Order." EDI stands for Electronic Data Interchange, which is a standardized electronic format for exchanging business documents between different entities, such as suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers.

The EDI 940 transaction set, Warehouse Shipping Order, is used to communicate information related to the shipment of goods from a warehouse to a specific destination. It provides details about the products being shipped, their quantities, packaging instructions, and shipping instructions.

Here are some of the key elements typically found in an EDI 940 transaction:

1. Header Information: Contains general information about the transaction, such as the sender and receiver's identification, date and time of transmission, and a unique control number.

2. Shipment Information: Includes details about the shipment, such as the shipment identification number, shipping method, expected ship date, and the requested delivery date.

3. Item Detail: Describes the individual items being shipped, including their item numbers, quantities, unit of measure, and any special instructions for handling or packaging.

4. Pack Information: Specifies how the items are packed, such as the number of cartons, pallets, or containers used, as well as their dimensions and weight.

5. Transportation Detail: Provides information about the transportation carrier, including their name, identification number, and any special routing instructions.

6. Summary Section: Contains summary information, such as the total number of items shipped, the total weight, and any additional charges or allowances.

The EDI 940 transaction set streamlines the communication process between trading partners involved in the shipping and receiving of goods, enabling more efficient and accurate exchange of information.
