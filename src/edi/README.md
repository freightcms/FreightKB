In the context of freight and logistics, EDI stands for **Electronic Data Interchange**. It refers to the electronic exchange of business documents and information between different parties involved in the freight industry, such as shippers, carriers, <a href="/parties/freight-forwarder">freight forwarders,</a> and customs agencies.

EDI enables the transfer of structured data electronically in a standardized format, allowing for efficient and automated communication between trading partners. It eliminates the need for manual data entry, paper-based documentation, and traditional communication methods like fax or email. EDI helps streamline various freight-related processes, including order placement, <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> tracking, customs documentation, invoicing, and payment reconciliation.

By using EDI, freight companies can achieve greater accuracy, speed, and visibility in their operations. It promotes seamless information flow, reduces errors and delays, and enhances overall supply chain efficiency. EDI standards, such as ANSI X12 and UN/EDIFACT, define the specific formats and protocols for data exchange, ensuring compatibility and interoperability between different systems and organizations.

Overall, EDI plays a crucial role in modern freight management, facilitating the exchange of data and streamlining processes to support timely and reliable delivery of goods.
