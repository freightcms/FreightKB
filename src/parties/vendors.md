A freight vendor, also known as a freight carrier or freight service provider, is a company or organization that specializes in transporting goods or cargo from one <a href="/locations/">location</a> to another. Freight vendors offer various transportation services to businesses and individuals, facilitating the movement of goods across different regions or even internationally.

Freight vendors can provide a range of transportation options, including:

- Air Freight Companies: These vendors specialize in transporting cargo by air, utilizing cargo planes and freight services offered by commercial airlines. Air freight is often preferred for time-sensitive or high-value shipments.

- Rail Freight Companies: These vendors operate rail services for transporting goods over long distances. Rail freight is commonly used for bulk <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> or when cost-effective transportation is required.

- Courier and Parcel Services: These vendors provide small-scale transportation services for packages and parcels. They often offer express or overnight delivery options and have a widespread network for efficient distribution.
