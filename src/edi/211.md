**EDI 211** refers to the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) document known as the Motor Carrier Bill of Lading. EDI is a standardized format for exchanging business documents electronically between different computer systems. The **EDI 211** document specifically relates to the transportation industry and is used to provide information about the <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> of goods by a motor <a href="/carriers">carrier.</a>

The Motor Carrier Bill of Lading (**EDI 211**) contains essential information about the <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipment,</a> such as the names and addresses of the shipper, consignee, and <a href="/carriers/">carrier,</a> the description of the goods being transported, the weight and quantity of the goods, and other relevant details. It serves as a contract between the <a href="/parties/shipper">shipper</a> and the <a href="/carriers/">carrier,</a> outlining the terms and conditions of the transportation service.

By utilizing EDI technology, companies can exchange the **EDI 211** document electronically, which streamlines the information flow and eliminates the need for manual data entry and paper documents. This improves efficiency, reduces errors, and facilitates faster processing of transportation-related information between trading partners in the supply chain.
