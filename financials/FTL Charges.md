FTL (Full Truckload) freight charges can vary based on several factors. Here are some common charges associated with FTL freight:

1. Linehaul Rate: This is the primary charge for transporting the freight from the origin to the destination. It is usually calculated based on the distance traveled, taking into account factors like fuel costs, tolls, and driver wages.

2. Accessorial Charges: These are additional charges that may apply based on specific requirements or services beyond the standard transportation. Examples include liftgate service, inside delivery, residential pickup or delivery, driver assist, detention charges (for delays at pickup or delivery), and expedited service.

3. Fuel Surcharge: Due to the fluctuating cost of fuel, carriers often include a fuel surcharge as a separate fee or as part of the linehaul rate. This surcharge helps offset the carrier's increased fuel expenses.

4. Equipment Type: The type of equipment needed for the shipment can affect the charges. For example, if specialized equipment like a refrigerated trailer or a flatbed is required, the rates may be higher than standard dry van rates.

5. Weight and Dimensions: The weight and size of the shipment play a role in determining the charges. Carriers may have weight restrictions or surcharges for overweight or oversized shipments due to the additional strain they put on the equipment.

6. Distance and Lane: The distance between the pickup and delivery locations, as well as the specific transportation lane or route, can impact the charges. Longer distances or routes with less available capacity may result in higher rates.

7. Seasonal or Peak Surcharges: During peak seasons or times of high demand, carriers may impose surcharges to account for increased operational costs or limited capacity.

It's important to note that specific pricing structures and charges can vary between carriers, so it's advisable to reach out to freight service providers or carriers directly to get accurate and detailed information regarding their charges for FTL freight.
