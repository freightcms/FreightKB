IATA stands for the International Air Transport Association. An IATA code, also known as an IATA location identifier or IATA airport code, is a three-letter code used to identify airports and other air transportation facilities around the world. These codes are assigned by IATA and are used for various purposes in the aviation industry, such as flight planning, ticketing, baggage handling, and general communication between airlines and airports.

IATA codes are typically based on the name or location of the airport they represent, but they may not always correspond directly to the airport's name or city. For example, the IATA code for London Heathrow Airport is "LHR," and the code for John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City is "JFK."

In addition to airport codes, IATA also assigns codes for airlines, aircraft types, cities, and other entities related to air transportation. These codes are widely used in the airline industry to ensure efficient and standardized communication and operations.
