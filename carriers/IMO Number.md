A Freight IMO (International Maritime Organization) number, also known as a container IMO number or shipping container number, is a unique identification code assigned to shipping containers. The IMO number helps in the identification and tracking of containers as they move across different ports and vessels worldwide.

The IMO number is typically displayed on the sides of shipping containers in the form of a unique seven-digit serial number preceded by the letters "IMO." For example, IMO 1234567. This number is used to identify and track individual containers, ensuring efficient management, monitoring, and security throughout their transportation journey.

The IMO number is particularly important in international maritime trade as it allows shipping companies, port authorities, and customs officials to accurately track containers, verify their contents, and ensure compliance with international regulations and safety standards.

It's worth noting that the IMO number is different from the IMO ship identification number, which is a unique seven-digit number assigned to individual ships and vessels.
