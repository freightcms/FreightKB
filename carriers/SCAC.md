SCAC stands for Standard Carrier Alpha Code. It is a unique two-to-four-letter code assigned by the National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) to identify transportation companies in the United States. The SCAC code is used primarily in the transportation industry for various purposes, including shipment tracking, freight bill auditing, and identifying carriers involved in logistics and supply chain management.

The SCAC code provides a standardized and efficient way to identify carriers, especially in electronic data interchange (EDI) systems and other automated processes. It helps ensure accurate and reliable communication between different parties involved in transportation, such as shippers, consignees, freight forwarders, and regulatory authorities.

Each SCAC code represents a specific carrier or transportation company, enabling quick identification and differentiation of various entities in the industry. The code is unique to each company and is used as a shorthand reference in transportation documents, contracts, and transactions.
