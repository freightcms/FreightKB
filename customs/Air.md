When shipping air freight from the United States, there are several U.S. customs documents that may be required, depending on the nature of the shipment and the destination. Here are some commonly used customs documents for air freight:

1. Commercial Invoice: This document provides details about the goods being shipped, including their description, value, quantity, and other relevant information. It is used for customs clearance and to determine import duties and taxes.

2. Air Waybill (AWB): An AWB is a transportation document issued by the airline or freight forwarder. It serves as a contract of carriage between the shipper and the carrier and contains information about the consignor, consignee, flight details, and a brief description of the goods.

3. Packing List: A packing list provides a detailed breakdown of the contents of each package or shipment, including the dimensions, weight, and itemized list of goods. It helps customs officers verify the contents and compare them with the commercial invoice.

4. Shipper's Letter of Instruction (SLI): The SLI is a document that provides detailed instructions to the freight forwarder or customs broker handling the shipment. It includes information about the shipper, consignee, description of goods, and any special handling or customs requirements.

5. Export License or Permits: Certain goods require an export license or permit before they can be shipped out of the United States. These licenses are typically issued by the relevant government agencies and may be necessary for items such as controlled substances, firearms, or certain high-tech products.

6. Certificates of Origin: Some countries require a Certificate of Origin to determine the country of manufacture of the goods. This document may be necessary to claim preferential trade agreements or to comply with import regulations of the destination country.

7. Other Documentation: Depending on the nature of the goods, additional documents may be required. For example, hazardous materials may need a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), and food or agricultural products may require specific certifications or inspections.

It's important to note that the specific customs requirements can vary based on the destination country, the nature of the goods being shipped, and any applicable trade agreements. It's recommended to consult with a freight forwarder, customs broker, or the relevant authorities to ensure compliance with all necessary customs documentation requirements for your specific shipment.
