A **Master Bill of Lading (MBL)** is a legal shipping document issued by the <a href="/carriers/">carrier</a> or <a href="/parties/freight-forwarder">freight forwarder</a>. It serves as a contract of carriage and receipt of goods for international <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> involving multiple parties, such as <a href="/parties/freight-forwarder">freight forwarders,</a> consolidators, and shipping lines.

The MBL is typically issued by the shipping line or the <a href="/carriers/">carrier</a> responsible for the main transport leg of the <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipment.</a> It outlines the terms and conditions of the transportation contract and includes important information such as the names and addresses of the shipper, consignee, and <a href="/carriers/">carrier,</a> as well as details about the goods being shipped.

One key feature of the MBL is that it covers the entire <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> from the port of origin to the final destination. It acts as a master document that governs the relationship between the <a href="/carriers/">carrier</a> and the shipper. However, when the goods are divided into smaller shipments, the <a href="/carriers/">carrier</a> may issue House Bills of Lading (HBLs) to each individual <a href="/parties/shipper">shipper</a> or consolidator involved in the transaction.

The MBL also serves as a transferable document, allowing the <a href="/parties/shipper">shipper</a> or <a href="/parties/freight-forwarder">freight forwarder</a> to endorse or transfer its rights to another party, such as a consignee or another <a href="/parties/freight-forwarder">freight forwarder</a>. This flexibility enables the consolidation and deconsolidation of cargo during the transportation process.

Overall, the **Master Bill of Lading** is an essential document in international shipping, as it provides a legal record of the <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipment's</a> details, terms, and conditions, while facilitating the smooth movement of goods between multiple <a href="/parties">parties</a> involved in the logistics chain.
