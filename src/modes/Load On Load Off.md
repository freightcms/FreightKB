"Load on, load off" freight refers to a specific type of cargo handling method commonly used in maritime shipping. It is also known as "lo-lo" or "lift-on/lift-off" freight.

In this method, cargo is loaded and unloaded from a ship using specialized equipment such as cranes or gantry systems. The cargo is lifted off the ship's deck or from a dock and placed onto the port or <a href="/locations/terminal">terminal</a>. Similarly, when loading, the cargo is lifted from the port or <a href="/locations/terminal">terminal</a> and placed onto the ship.

Load on, load off (LOLO) freight is commonly used for shipping containers, heavy machinery, oversized cargo, or any other items that cannot be easily rolled on or off the vessel. It allows for efficient loading and unloading of goods, making it a preferred method for many types of cargo that require special handling.

This method contrasts with "roll-on/roll-off" (Ro-Ro) freight, where cargo can be driven or towed directly onto and off the ship using ramps or specialized vehicles. Ro-Ro is typically used for vehicles, such as cars, trucks, and trailers.

Both load on, load off and roll-on/roll-off methods offer advantages depending on the type of cargo being transported and the specific requirements of the shipping process.
