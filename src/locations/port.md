****ports**** facilitate the movement of cargo through various modes of transportation. The primary modes include maritime (sea transport), road transport, rail transport, air transport, and pipeline transport. Additionally, specific methods of cargo handling at **ports** include Roll-on/Roll-off (RoRo) and Load On/Load Off (LoLo).

1. **Maritime (Sea Transport):** Cargo is transported by ships, and **ports** provide facilities for loading and unloading vessels.

2. **Road Transport:** Trucks are commonly used to transport cargo to and from **ports**, especially for short-distance transportation within a country.

3. **Rail Transport:** **ports** may be connected to rail networks, allowing for the efficient movement of cargo by trains, particularly for landlocked **ports**.

4. **Air Transport:** Some high-value or time-sensitive cargo may be transported by air, and some **ports** have nearby air**ports** or air cargo facilities.

5. **Pipeline Transport:** In certain cases, pipelines may be used for transporting specific types of cargo, such as liquids or gases.

Specific methods of cargo handling at **ports** include:
- **Roll-on/Roll-off (RoRo):** Wheeled cargo is driven onto and off of vessels without the need for cranes.
  
- **Load On/Load Off (LoLo):** Cranes or lifting equipment are used to load and unload a variety of cargo types onto and from vessels.

Additionally, for short-distance transportation, the term **drayage** is used. Drayage involves moving containers or cargo over short distances using trucks, connecting **ports** to nearby destinations like warehouses or distribution centers. These methods collectively contribute to the efficiency and flexibility of cargo movement at **ports**, catering to different types of cargo and transportation requirements.
