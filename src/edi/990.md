In the realm of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), the EDI 990 is a specific transaction set commonly known as the "Response to a Load Tender." The EDI 990 transaction provides information about the acceptance or rejection of a shipment tendered by a shipper. It is a way for the recipient (usually a carrier or transportation provider) to communicate back to the shipper regarding their decision to accept or decline the offered load.

The key details typically included in an EDI 990 transaction may encompass the confirmation of acceptance, the specific details of the accepted shipment, any conditions or requirements for transport, and reasons for rejection if applicable. This transaction helps streamline communication and coordination between trading partners in the logistics and transportation industry, ensuring a more efficient and automated exchange of information related to the transportation of goods.
