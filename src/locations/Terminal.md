In freight logistics, a **terminal** refers to a specific <a href="/locations/">location</a> or facility where various activities related to the movement, storage, and transfer of cargo or freight take place. These terminals are essential components of the supply chain and play a crucial role in the transportation and distribution of goods.

There are different types of terminals in freight logistics, each serving a specific purpose:

- **Port Terminal:** A port **terminal** is located at a seaport and handles the loading and unloading of cargo to and from ships. It accommodates containers, bulk cargo, and other types of freight, facilitating the transfer of goods between maritime vessels and other transportation modes like trucks and trains.
- **Container Terminal:** This type of **terminal**specializes in handling containerized cargo. It is equipped with facilities and equipment, such as container cranes and storage yards, to efficiently manage containers from ships to trucks or trains and vice versa.
- **Intermodal Terminal:** An intermodal terminal, also known as an inland port or rail terminal, serves as an interchange point between different modes of transportation. It facilitates the transfer of freight between ships, trucks, and trains, making it possible to transport goods seamlessly across various transportation networks.
- **Air Cargo Terminal:** This **terminal** is situated at an airport and is responsible for handling air freight. It deals with the loading, unloading, sorting, and storage of cargo that is transported by air.
- **Railway Terminal:** A railway terminal, also known as a rail yard or rail terminal, manages the consolidation, distribution, and transfer of goods on rail networks. It is where freight trains are assembled and disassembled, and cargo is loaded or unloaded.
- **Truck Terminal / Distribution Center:** This **terminal** serves as a hub for truck-based transportation, where goods are received, sorted, and dispatched to their respective destinations via trucks.

In all types of freight terminals, various logistics and supply chain activities are carried out, including cargo handling, warehousing, customs clearance, documentation, security, and transportation coordination. These terminals play a crucial role in optimizing the flow of goods, reducing transit times, and ensuring the smooth functioning of the freight transportation process.
