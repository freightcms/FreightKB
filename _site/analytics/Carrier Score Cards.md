Carrier performance refers to the measurement and evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of a carrier or transportation service provider. A carrier, in this context, refers to a company or organization that transports goods, people, or information from one location to another.

Carrier performance can be assessed based on several key factors, including:

1. On-time delivery: This metric evaluates the carrier's ability to deliver shipments within the specified timeframes or agreed-upon schedules. It considers factors such as transit time, adherence to pickup and delivery windows, and overall punctuality.

2. Shipment accuracy: This refers to the carrier's ability to deliver shipments without loss, damage, or errors. It involves assessing the carrier's handling practices, tracking capabilities, and accuracy in maintaining the integrity of the goods being transported.

3. Cost-effectiveness: Evaluating carrier performance includes analyzing the overall cost of transportation services provided. This involves assessing factors such as pricing competitiveness, service quality relative to the cost, and value for money.

4. Customer service: The quality of customer service is a crucial aspect of carrier performance. This includes factors such as responsiveness, communication, problem-solving capabilities, and the overall customer experience throughout the shipping process.

5. Safety and compliance: Carrier performance assessment also considers adherence to safety regulations and compliance with industry standards. This involves evaluating the carrier's safety record, training programs, equipment maintenance, and compliance with legal requirements.

6. Sustainability: In recent years, sustainability has gained importance in evaluating carrier performance. It involves assessing environmental impact, energy efficiency, carbon footprint, and the carrier's commitment to sustainable practices and initiatives.

Carrier performance assessment is typically conducted by shippers, logistics providers, or organizations that rely on transportation services. The evaluation helps in selecting and managing carriers, identifying areas for improvement, and ensuring efficient and reliable transportation of goods or services.
