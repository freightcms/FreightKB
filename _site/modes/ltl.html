    <p>A less than truckload (LTL) shipment refers to a freight shipment that does not require the use of an entire truck trailer. LTL carriers consolidate multiple smaller shipments from different shippers into a single trailer, optimizing space and reducing costs. Here are some key attributes that a less than truckload shipment typically needs to have:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Smaller Size: LTL shipments are generally smaller in size compared to full truckload (FTL) shipments. They usually occupy a fraction of the available trailer space.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Weight Limit: LTL shipments have weight restrictions, often ranging from around 150 to 20,000 pounds (68 to 9,072 kilograms). The exact weight limit varies depending on the carrier and the equipment they use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Packaging and Palletization: LTL shipments need to be appropriately packaged and palletized to ensure safe transportation. Proper packaging helps protect the goods from damage during handling and transit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consignment Documentation: LTL shipments require accurate and detailed consignment documentation, including a bill of lading (BOL), which specifies the origin, destination, contents, weight, and other relevant information about the shipment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Freight Class: Each LTL shipment is assigned a freight class, which is determined by its density, stowability, handling requirements, and liability. The freight class helps determine the shipping rates and any additional charges associated with the shipment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pick-up and Delivery Flexibility: LTL carriers typically offer pick-up and delivery services to and from various locations. Shippers should ensure that their shipment can be conveniently picked up from the origin and delivered to the destination, considering factors such as access restrictions and time frames.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tracking and Tracing: LTL carriers provide tracking and tracing services to monitor the progress and location of the shipment. This helps both the shipper and the recipient stay informed about the status of the shipment and its estimated time of arrival.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Freight Insurance: Depending on the value and nature of the goods being shipped, it is advisable to consider appropriate freight insurance to cover any potential loss or damage during transit.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Itâ€™s important to note that specific requirements and attributes may vary depending on the LTL carrier, regional regulations, and the nature of the goods being shipped. Shippers should always consult with their chosen carrier to understand their specific guidelines and requirements for LTL shipments.</p>
