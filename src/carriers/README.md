- MC Number (Motor Carrier Number): This is an identification number assigned by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to interstate<a href="/carriers/">carriers</a>operating in the United States. It is required for<a href="/carriers/">carriers</a>engaged in interstate commerce.

It is used to identify<a href="/carriers/">carriers</a>in computer systems and shipping documents.
