A Freight Handling Unit (FHU) refers to a specific package or item that is used to transport goods in the freight industry. It is designed to facilitate the movement of cargo by various modes of transportation, such as ships, airplanes, trains, and trucks. An FHU can be a standardized shipping container, pallet, skid, crate, or any other similar structure used for consolidating and securing goods during transportation.

The purpose of a Freight Handling Unit is to ensure efficient and safe handling of cargo throughout the transportation process. By utilizing standardized units, it becomes easier to load, unload, stack, and secure freight, thereby streamlining logistics operations and reducing the risk of damage or loss. Freight Handling Units often adhere to industry-standard dimensions and specifications to enable compatibility and interoperability across different transportation systems.

These units are typically designed to withstand the rigors of transportation, including stacking, handling by equipment like forklifts, and exposure to various weather conditions. They provide a means of protecting the goods during transit and make it easier to handle multiple items as a single unit.

Overall, Freight Handling Units play a crucial role in the logistics and transportation industry by providing a standardized and efficient method of packaging, handling, and moving goods, enhancing supply chain efficiency and ensuring the integrity of cargo during transit.
