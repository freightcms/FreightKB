Break bulk freight refers to a type of cargo that is transported individually and not in containers or bulk quantities. It is typically characterized by being loaded and unloaded piece by piece or in smaller groups. Break bulk cargo can include a wide range of goods such as machinery, equipment, vehicles, timber, steel, project cargo, and other non-containerized items.

Unlike containerized or bulk cargo, which are loaded and unloaded using specialized equipment like cranes or conveyor systems, break bulk cargo requires manual handling and often involves palletizing or securing the items on specialized platforms or in crates, barrels, or sacks. This method of transportation is commonly used for oversized, heavy, or uniquely shaped items that cannot fit into standard containers or be transported in bulk.

Break bulk freight is typically transported on specialized vessels known as break bulk ships or general cargo ships. These ships are equipped with onboard cranes and other equipment necessary for loading and unloading the cargo at ports or terminals. Break bulk cargo is usually stowed below deck for protection against weather conditions and to ensure the stability of the vessel.

While containerization has become increasingly popular in modern shipping due to its efficiency and ease of handling, break bulk shipping still serves an important role in transporting certain types of cargo that are not suitable for containerized or bulk transportation.
