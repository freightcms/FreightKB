**EDI 810** refers to an electronic data interchange (EDI) transaction set that is used in business-to-business (B2B) communications. Specifically, **EDI 810** is the standard format for transmitting an <a href="/financials/invoices">invoice</a> electronically between trading partners. It is part of the ANSI X12 EDI standard, which is widely used in North America.

The **EDI 810** document contains key information related to a commercial <a href="/financials/invoices">invoice</a>, including details such as:

- **Billing and payment terms:** It specifies the agreed-upon terms for payment, such as due date, discount terms, and late payment penalties.
- **Itemized charges:** The <a href="/financials/invoices">invoice</a> provides a breakdown of individual products, services, or charges, along with their quantities, prices, and any applicable discounts or taxes.
- **Shipping and delivery information:** It includes details about the <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipment,</a> such as shipping dates, tracking numbers, carrier information, and delivery instructions.
- **Purchase order references:** If the <a href="/financials/invoices">invoice</a> corresponds to a specific purchase order, the **EDI 810** may reference the relevant purchase order number for easy reconciliation and verification.
- **Remittance details:** The document may include information on how and where to send payment, such as bank account details or instructions for electronic funds transfer (EFT).

By using the standardized format of **EDI 810**, trading partners can streamline their <a href="/financials/invoices">invoicing</a> processes, reduce manual data entry, minimize errors, and enhance efficiency in their business transactions.
