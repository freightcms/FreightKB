**Freight accessorials**, also known as freight accessorial charges or fees, refer to additional services or charges associated with the transportation of freight beyond the basic transportation cost. These charges are incurred for extra services or special requirements that go beyond the standard pickup, transportation, and delivery of goods.

**Freight accessorials** can vary depending on the specific requirements of the <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> and the carrier's policies. Some common types of **freight accessorials** include:

- **Liftgate Service:** This service is required when a <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> needs to be loaded or unloaded using a hydraulic liftgate on the truck, typically because the pickup or delivery <a href="/locations/">location</a> lacks a loading dock.

- **Inside Delivery:** If the destination for the freight is within a building or requires the carrier to go beyond the loading dock, an inside delivery charge may apply. This can involve carrying the goods inside, unloading them in a specific area, or taking them up or down stairs.

- **Residential Delivery:** If the pickup or delivery <a href="/locations/">location</a> is a residential area, an additional fee may be charged due to the additional effort and resources required for navigating residential streets and delivering to a private residence.

- **Limited Access Delivery:** This charge applies when the pickup or delivery <a href="/locations/">location</a> is in an area that is considered difficult to access, such as construction sites, schools, government facilities, or remote areas. Limited access sites may require special arrangements, additional time, or alternative transportation methods.

- **Notification Services:** Some <a href="/carriers/">carriers</a> offer notification services to inform the recipient of an impending delivery. This may include advanced phone calls or emails to schedule the delivery appointment or provide updates on the shipment's status.

- **Storage Fees:** If a <a href="/glossery/shipments">shipments</a> cannot be delivered or picked up immediately and requires storage at a carrier's facility, storage fees may be imposed for holding the goods for a specific period.

- **Redelivery Charges:** If a delivery attempt is unsuccessful due to the recipient not being available or refusing the delivery, a redelivery fee may be applied to cover the cost of making subsequent delivery attempts.

It's important to note that different <a href="/carriers/">carriers</a> may have their own specific list of **freight accessorials** and associated charges. It is advisable to review the <a href="/carriers/">carrier's</a> terms and conditions or consult with them directly to understand the specific accessorials they offer and the corresponding costs.
