A Freight MC Number, also known as an MC (Motor Carrier) Number, is a unique identifier assigned to for-hire motor carriers (trucking companies) by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) in the United States. The MC Number is used to track and monitor the operations of motor carriers engaged in interstate commerce.

Obtaining an MC Number is a requirement for motor carriers involved in transporting regulated commodities or providing transportation services across state lines. It serves as proof of registration with the FMCSA and is used for various regulatory and safety purposes. The MC Number is displayed on the sides of commercial motor vehicles to identify the carrier and facilitate inspections and enforcement activities.

The MC Number is part of a larger identifier called the USDOT (United States Department of Transportation) Number, which is also assigned by the FMCSA. The MC Number is typically issued in combination with the USDOT Number and is often referred to as MC/USDOT Number.
