EDI 210 refers to a specific transaction set within the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) standards. EDI is a structured electronic format for exchanging business documents between different computer systems without human intervention.

The EDI 210 transaction set is known as the Motor Carrier Freight Details and Invoice. It is primarily used in the transportation industry, specifically for the exchange of billing and payment information related to freight transportation services. The transaction set provides a standardized format for transmitting details such as shipment identification, charges, and payment terms between carriers and shippers.

The EDI 210 typically includes information about the carrier, shipper, consignee, shipment dates, services provided, charges for transportation, accessorial services, and any applicable taxes or surcharges. It serves as a way to streamline the invoicing and payment processes between trading partners, reducing manual paperwork and improving efficiency in the transportation and logistics industry.
