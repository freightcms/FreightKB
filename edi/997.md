EDI 997 is an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) document used in business-to-business (B2B) transactions. It is commonly referred to as an "Acknowledgment" or "Functional Acknowledgment" document. 

The EDI 997 serves as a confirmation that an EDI transaction has been successfully received and processed by the recipient's computer system. It is typically sent in response to an inbound EDI document, such as a purchase order or an invoice. The sender of the original EDI document expects to receive the EDI 997 as a way to ensure that their transaction was received and understood.

The EDI 997 is structured in a standardized format defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12. It contains information such as the sender and recipient identification, transaction control numbers, and timestamps. The document may include status codes indicating whether the original transaction was accepted, rejected, or encountered any errors during processing.

The purpose of the EDI 997 is to provide a mechanism for reliable communication between trading partners using EDI. It helps to ensure the integrity of the EDI exchange by confirming the successful transmission and processing of documents. The sender can use the EDI 997 to track the progress of their transactions, resolve any discrepancies, and maintain a record of successful transmissions.

Overall, the EDI 997 plays a crucial role in facilitating smooth EDI-based transactions by providing acknowledgment and verification of the data exchange between trading partners.
