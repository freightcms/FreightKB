Roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) transportation refers to a method of shipping cargo or freight using vessels specifically designed to allow vehicles to be driven directly onto the ship and then driven off at the destination port. RoRo vessels are equipped with ramps or specialized platforms that facilitate the easy movement of wheeled cargo, such as cars, trucks, trailers, and heavy machinery.

The concept behind RoRo transportation is to streamline the loading and unloading process by eliminating the need for cranes or other lifting equipment. Vehicles can be driven onto the ship at the port of origin, securely parked and lashed down, and then driven off at the destination port. This method is particularly efficient for shipping large quantities of vehicles or other heavy equipment.

RoRo transportation is commonly used for international trade, where goods need to be transported across bodies of water. It is especially popular for the shipment of automobiles, as it provides a cost-effective and convenient means of transportation. RoRo vessels are designed to handle various types of cargo, including both self-propelled vehicles and towed units.

The advantages of RoRo transportation include faster loading and unloading times compared to other methods, reduced handling of cargo, and the ability to transport a large volume of vehicles or heavy machinery in a single shipment. Additionally, the risk of damage during the loading and unloading process is minimized, as vehicles remain securely parked throughout the journey.

Overall, RoRo transportation offers a reliable and efficient solution for shipping wheeled cargo internationally, providing a vital link in global trade and logistics.
