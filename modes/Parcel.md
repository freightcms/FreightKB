A parcel shipment typically has several attributes that help identify and track the package throughout the delivery process. Here are some common attributes associated with parcel shipments:

1. Tracking Number: A unique identifier assigned to each parcel for tracking purposes. It allows both the sender and recipient to monitor the package's progress.

2. Origin and Destination Addresses: The address from where the parcel is sent and the address to which it is being delivered.

3. Weight and Dimensions: The weight and size measurements of the parcel, which determine the shipping cost and help in determining the appropriate transportation method.

4. Contents Description: A brief description of the items enclosed within the parcel. This helps customs officials and carriers identify any restricted or prohibited items.

5. Delivery Service: The chosen delivery service or carrier responsible for transporting the parcel, such as FedEx, UPS, DHL, or national postal services.

6. Shipping Method: The selected shipping method, such as ground shipping, express delivery, overnight, or air freight. This determines the speed and cost of delivery.

7. Delivery Status: Information about the current location and status of the parcel during transit, including pickup, in transit, out for delivery, delivered, or any exceptions or delays encountered.

8. Estimated Delivery Date: An approximate date provided by the carrier indicating when the parcel is expected to reach its destination. This date may vary based on the shipping method chosen and unforeseen circumstances.

9. Proof of Delivery: A record indicating that the parcel has been successfully delivered to the intended recipient. This can include a recipient's signature, a timestamp, or a delivery confirmation notice.

10. Insurance: Optional insurance coverage purchased by the sender to protect the value of the shipment against loss, damage, or theft during transit.

These attributes may vary depending on the carrier, shipping service, and any additional features or options selected by the sender.
